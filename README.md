DeepLeuko is an AI based Multiclass Classification of leukemia using Deep learning. Our 
approach is centered around CNN-based deep learning models due to their effectiveness in 
visual pattern recognition. Additionally, transformer models may be incorporated to further 
improve classification performance where necessary. The goal is to assist medical professionals 
in making faster and more reliable diagnoses at early stages. The trained model is deployed 
through a web-based interface, allowing users such as doctors and lab technicians to perform 
real-time leukemia detection and classification efficiently.
